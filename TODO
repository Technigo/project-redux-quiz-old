# 🔵 Requirements

- Your quiz should have at least 5 questions.✅
- When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not. -> Ida, Maria + Isabel
- While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'. -> Emelie + Nina ✅
- When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen which tells them how many they got correct or incorrect. -> Emelie ✅
- You should challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components which interact with the store - don't just go for one big component. // Progress Bar, maybe we want images of them too? 👈
- Don't forget CSS! Your quiz should be well styled.
