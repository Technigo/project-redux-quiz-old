# Redux quiz group project

Five people collaborated on this project to develop a React and Redux-based multiple-choice quiz game. Users answer questions, and the game displays the current or remaining question count. Finally, a summary screen shows the number of correct and incorrect answers.

## The problem

We branched out and worked separately on different components during the week.
After that we mob-programmed and fixed merging and styling together before deploying the project.
If we had more time we would do more on the styling, and add more questions and functionality.
