# Redux quiz group project

Leo Thunell, Eva Sjöholm, and Jennifer Feenstra-Arengård worked as a group to create this quiz using React and Redux.

## The problem

First we created a Figma design with all of the requirements, questions, and ideas of how the project should work. From there we created the repository and divided the work among the team. Some members worked on branches to create components which were merged later in the project. We focused first on the functionality of the components to create the quiz and then styled it with styled components.
