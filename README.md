# Redux quiz group project

The task was to build a quiz game using React, Redux and styled components.


## The problem

With the group we started planning how the application would look (pages, resuable styled components etc), visualized it with a sketch and planned the steps of the implementation.
We first used mob programming approach to create the basic logic using Redux, then worked on separate branches to style the pages and position the components.
