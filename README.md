# Redux quiz group project - Overview
Mob programming project with four others in my group. Over two collaboration days, our team's task was to build a multiple choice quiz using Redux on a topic of our choosing.

Learning objectives:
- How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions
- Practice working in a development team


<!-- ## Approach -->


## Core Tech
- Redux
- React
- JSX
- Styled-Components

## Completed Requirements
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- The quiz should have at least 5 questions.
- When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
- While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'.
- When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen which tells them how many they got correct or incorrect.
- Challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components which interact with the store - don't just go for one big component.
- Don't forget CSS! Your quiz should be well styled.

ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
- After selecting an answer, highlight the correct answer if they chose incorrectly.
<!-- - Create a visual progress bar showing how many questions are left to be answered. -->
<!-- - Use images or videos to make your questions and answers look richer. -->
<!-- - Give a score for correct answers and deduct points for incorrect answers. If the user goes below a certain score, they lose! -->
<!-- - Enrich the summary with information about what questions they got correct and what questions they should practice more -->

<!-- âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals) -->
<!-- - Implement a countdown timer to answer the question - if the user doesn't answer in time, they get the question wrong. -->
<!-- - Implement a timer to show the user how long it took to complete the quiz. -->
