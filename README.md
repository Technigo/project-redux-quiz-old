The first project familiarizing us with Redux and how to manage global state in React. It was originally a group project but scheduling issues meant that I had to work alone. I took the idea of a quiz about React from my original group, but I coded and styled the quiz myself.

## The problem

As this was my first time working with Redux, I was pretty intimidated. I understand the benefits of Redux, especially when you're working with a larger code base, but the logic is still quite abstract. I had some trouble understanding how the amount of correct and incorrect answers is stored in the Redux slice. This was also the first time I used an custom alert package, which I found really fun to style.
