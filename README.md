# Redux quiz group project

This week we learned about the global state using Redux. It was a group programming project, and we had the best team!

Team members: Ida Halling, Therese Nyman, Vanessa Hajek & Joanna Lodell

The task was to build a quiz game with multiple choices using Redux. We defined our own questions and possible answers. We chose a theme that inspire us.

We started with making a jamboard with choices for design and app-structure, we also set up a kanban-board and our joint schedule in our notionpage. Because of slightly different schedules we divided the work and made branches to be more efficient. We are really proud of our project.

If we had more time we would have made some of our components more advanced, like counters. We also would have liked to build the app mobile first. Looking forward to learn that the coming weeks.
