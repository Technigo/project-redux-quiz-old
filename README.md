# Redux quiz group project

A music quiz game using Redux. It's a multiple choice quiz, so we defined our own questions and a bunch of possible answers!

## The problem

We planed the work and sketched out our page using a jamboard. Then we created the components and adjusted the reducer to fit our quiz. We kept it simple to be able to focusing on understanding Redux and develop our knowledge in React. Last, we styled everything using styled components.
