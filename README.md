# Redux Harry Potter quiz

A quiz developed with Redux.

## The problem

- Used selectors to access redux state and dispatch to trigger redux actions.
- Used selectors and dispatches to interact with our Redux store
- We have an intro page to start the quiz.
- We built three different question-components that are renedered depending on the  
  question type, making a total of ten questions.
- The summary page displays the users answers and the correct answers. The user can  
  re-take the quiz with a restart-button.
