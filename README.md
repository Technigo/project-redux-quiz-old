# Redux quiz group project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

# Running Locally

This is a short guide on how to run a Redux quiz project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies including `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `react-router-dom`.

## Running the Project

1. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
2. Once the server is started, you can view the project in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! You now have the Redux project up and running on your local machine with all the required dependencies installed.
