# Redux quiz group project

Friends quiz build with Redux, done in a group of five people during Technigo boot camp.

## The problem

After sketching our mobile first design on Figma, we planned and divided the components and started to work on the logic in pairs. Focus was to practise and learn useSelector and useDispatch, as this is our first Redux project.
