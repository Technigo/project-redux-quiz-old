# Redux quiz group project

This weeks project was a group project where we built a sports quiz game using Redux. Itâ€™s a multiple choice quiz beginning with a welcome page, a page that displays all the quiz questions and a results page showing all of the answers. 

## The problem

We worked with Redux and it was new to all of us, this was a challenging part of the project as redux has such a steep 
learning curve. We started off with creating a figma design, then moving onto displaying the data we needed from the 
store using the useSelector and then sending data back to the store using Dispatch. 

We learned a lot this week and I think our biggest challenge was deploying our project.
