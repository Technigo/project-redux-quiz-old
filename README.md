# Redux quiz group project

<<<<<<< HEAD
This assignment was to start working with Redux and how to implement the store
in your app.

## The problem

DThis was a group project so we started off working with mob programming, after
a while we split up in smaller groups focusing on smaller building blocks for
the app and features for the webpage.

These were the requirements:

- Your quiz should have at least 5 questions.
- When the user selects an answer, it should show if they were correct or not.
- While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how
  many left - for example 'Question 5 / 15' or '10 questions left'.
- When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary
  screen which tells them how many they got correct or incorrect.
- You should challenge yourself to make use of redux by making small components
  which interact with the store - don't just go for one big component.
- Don't forget CSS! Your quiz should be well styled.
