# Redux quiz group project

The assignment was to to build a quiz game using Redux. A multiple-choice quiz, with our own questions and a bunch of possible answers to present to the users.
This was a group project made by [Jonas](https://github.com/jonsjak), [Johanna](https://github.com/JohLeo), [Vera](https://github.com/Vera-Sjunnesson) & [Sammy](https://github.com/sammyolsson)

## The problem

We used Figma as a project planner, to list tasks and sketch design.
Regarding coding we went with the pair-programming approach with mobile first in mind.
We focused on the functionality of the components first and then styled the quiz with styled components.
