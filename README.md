# Redux quiz group project

For this project we worked in a team of four to create a short quiz using React and Redux.


## The problem

We began by discussing what our quiz should be about, and how we would be working together.  We decided to pair and mob program depending on each team member's availability. We focused on starting with the mechanics of the quiz and understanding Redux, universal state, how to get data from the store, and how to use dispatches.  Once the mechanics of the quiz worked, we updated our questions, and styled the quiz.

If we had more time, we would work on a few stretch goals like adding photos or enriching the summary with information about what questions the user got correct and what questions they should practice more.
