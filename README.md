# Redux quiz group project

The brief was to build a quiz game using Redux similar to Buzzfeed quizzes, using Redux store and a reducer with a few actions.

This week we learnt:

- What global state is
- How to use styled components
- What redux is
- How to use selectors to access redux state
- How to use dispatch to trigger redux actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions
- Merging git branches and managing conflicts

## The problem

We started with planning and mob programming to build a boilerplate. After that, we created several branches and used a kanban board to keep track of the project's status.

We met several times to merge and create new feature branches.
