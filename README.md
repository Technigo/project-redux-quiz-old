# Redux quiz group project

This is a website with a quiz made with Redux and React. The project was made in groups of 5 people: Emma Holtegaard, Emilia Granström Anundi, Nina Ströyer, Amanda Sjöström, and Maja Zimnoch. We used mob programming technique. 

## The problem

We used selectors to access redux state, and dispatch to trigger redux actions. Another challenge was to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching action. A lot of the redux was predefined, but we adapted it to fit our project. For the styling, we used styled components (with props). Most of the styled components were global.
For this project we used: JavaScript, React, CSS (styled-components), Redux.
If we had more time: We would add a progress bar and style the radiobuttons with images.
