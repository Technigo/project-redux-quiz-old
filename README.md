## What I learned 🧠

* How to interact with a global state using selectors and by dispatching actions

## Requirements 🧪

* The quiz should have at least 5 questions
* While going through the quiz, it should show which question you're on, or how many left 
* When the user has answered all the questions, they should get to a summary screen which tells them how many the got correct
* Having small components which interact with the store

## Stretch Goals I reached 🏃‍♂

* Used a countdown timer - if the user doesn't answer in time, they get the question wrong
* Used images related to the question
* Enabled and disabled buttons for different conditions
* Added a progressbar
